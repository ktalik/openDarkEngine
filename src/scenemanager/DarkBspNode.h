    /** Encapsulates a node in a BSP tree.
        A BSP tree represents space partitioned by planes . The space which is
        partitioned is either the world (in the case of the root node) or the space derived
        from their parent node. Each node can have elements which are in front or behind it, which are
        it's children and these elements can either be further subdivided by planes,
        or they can be undivided spaces or 'leaf nodes' - these are the nodes which actually contain
        objects and world geometry. The leaves of the tree are the stopping point of any tree walking algorithm,
        both for rendering and collision detection etc.</p>
        Ogre chooses not to represent splitting nodes and leaves as separate structures, but to merge the two for simplicity
        of the walking algorithm. If a node is a leaf, the isLeaf() method returns true and both getFront() and
        getBack() return null pointers. If the node is a partitioning plane isLeaf() returns false and getFront()
        and getBack() will return the corresponding BspNode objects.

	This version of BspNode, updated to be used by DarkSceneManager, implements Portals as members. It should be considered as a 'Cell' if it is a leaf.

		    of tree walking. However it is important that you use this method to determine which type you are dealing
		    with, since certain methods are only supported with one of the subtypes. Details are given in the individual methods.
		    Note that I could have represented splitting / leaf nodes as a class hierarchy but the
		    virtual methods / run-time type identification would have a performance hit, and it would not make the
		    code much (any?) simpler anyway. I think this is a fair trade-off in this case.
